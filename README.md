# Plants and Pollinators - Frontend #

Plants and Pollinators is an app to help gardeners plan a pollinator friendly garden. Users are able to see a list of plants and what pollinators are attracted to them as well as a list of pollinators with the plants they like.
By clicking on a plant or pollinator they can learn more about it. 
Users can also update information or add a new plant to the database with notes on the pollinators it attracts.
